I"*<p>Whenever I check my news feed on Facebook these days, I can see a plethora of Dipawali- photos. In these photos, some friends are playing Deusi- Bhailo, some are decorating their houses and some are playing cards. I can totally feel how the atmosphere of Nepal is right now. When I remember Tihar, vibrant lights, sparkling fireworks, vivacious Deusi- Bhailo and my lovely sisters come to my mind, and take me back in time to the past Tihars. But this time, these are just the moments from my memory. Very few people in New Orleans know about Tihar. There are lights everywhere, but these lights are not the lights of Dipawali. Even the dimmest light that enlightens the world, used to living in the darkness rest of the year, is special. So, these light are not the most special ones, at least for me.</p>
